Business profile creation and management
Service management (add, edit, delete services with duration and price)
Availability settings (business hours, breaks, days off)
Client booking interface with calendar view
Appointment management (view, reschedule, cancel)
Email notifications for bookings, reminders, and cancellations
Simple admin dashboard for business owners

2. User Stories
For Business Owners:

I want to create a business profile so clients can find my services
I want to define my working hours so clients only book when I'm available
I want to add services with prices and duration so clients know what I offer
I want to view all upcoming appointments in a calendar so I can plan my day
I want to receive notifications when appointments are booked or canceled
I want to block off time for breaks or days off so clients can't book then
I want to reschedule or cancel appointments with automatic client notification

For Clients:

I want to browse available services so I can choose what I need
I want to see available time slots so I can book at my convenience
I want to create an account to manage my appointments
I want to receive confirmation and reminder emails about my appointments
I want to reschedule or cancel my appointments if my plans change
I want to view my appointment history and upcoming bookings
I want to provide my contact information so the business can reach me
